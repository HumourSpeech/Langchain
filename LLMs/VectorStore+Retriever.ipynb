    "This tutorial will familiarize you with LangChain's vector store and retriever abstractions. These abstractions are designed to support retrieval of data-- from (vector) databases and other sources-- for integration with LLM workflows. They are important for applications that fetch data to be reasoned over as part of model inference, as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation.\n",

    "<h4>Documents</h4>\n",
    "LangChain implements a Document abstraction, which is intended to represent a unit of text and associated metadata. It has two attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- page_content: a string representing the content;\n",
    "- metadata: a dict containing arbitrary metadata.\n",
    "The metadata attribute can capture information about the source of the document, its relationship to other documents, and other information. Note that an individual Document object often represents a chunk of a larger document.\n",

    "- A Retrieval Chain is a process used in GenAI where the system first searches for relevant information (context) from a database or documents, and then sends that information along with the user’s question to the LLM.\n",
    "- This helps the model give more accurate and context-aware answers, especially when the model does not already know the information.\n",

    "So when a question comes in:\n",

    "1. Retriever searches all available documents\n",

    "2. Picks only the most useful/relevant ones\n",

    "4. LLM uses that context to generate a better and accurate answer\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Why is this important?</h4>\n",
    "\n",
